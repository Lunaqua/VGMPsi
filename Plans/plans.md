## Main Site Plans
### HomePage
The plan is for the homepage to very simple, probably using pico.css.
It will mostly act as a portal to other sites or projects.

### Files
The files section will act as a quick way of distributing files over the web. It'll also point to a potential ftp server.

### News and Updates
Will contain site news, updates, and announcements.

### Links
Will contain extra links to internal resources as well as external links.

### Contact
Basic contact details

## VGM
The new Video Games Marathon site will act as a large part of the overall website. It will be named Psi and will be a completely new design compared to v2.13.1(v3.64).
The design will most likely be custom, and will be slightly different for each list.

### Home, and Rules
The initial page will contain information, as well as a guide and rules for the challenge. It will be themed rather basically.

### Lists
The initial two lists will be themed accordingly and each game in the list will expand into more information either when clicked or hovered over.
This will contain:

- Some info on the game
- Some spiel on my opinion
- Cover art
- Route categories
- Completion Criteria
- Extra notes
